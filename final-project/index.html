<p>On the sloping campus of the University of Maryland, College Park, electric scooters can serve as a speedy travel alternative to biking up the infamous hill leading up to the Adele H. Stamp Student Union building.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 2019 academic year, the university partnered with VeoRide to distribute almost 300 electric bikes, scooters and pedaled bikes across campus and the surrounding areas. With the exception of personal Bird scooter rentals, VeoRide scooters can be used with a few simple clicks on a smartphone app. This offers the scooters as a temporary method of transportation.</p>
