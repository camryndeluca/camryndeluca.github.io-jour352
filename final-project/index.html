<h2> College campuses revamp electric scooter regulations </h2>

<p>On the sloping campus of the University of Maryland, College Park, electric scooters can serve as a speedy travel alternative to biking up the infamous hill leading up to the Adele H. Stamp Student Union building.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 2019 academic year, the university partnered with VeoRide to distribute almost 300 electric bikes, scooters and pedaled bikes across campus and the surrounding areas. With the exception of personal Bird scooter rentals, VeoRide scooters can be used with a few simple clicks on a smartphone app. This offers the scooters as a temporary method of transportation.</p>

<p>A semester of scooter rides later, and the university’s Department of Transportation Services has cracked down on more specific regulation for this new mode of transportation. Among these regulations is the prohibition of riding the scooters on sidewalks, while impaired and in “an unsafe manner.” DOTS considers impaired riding as wearing headphones or riding with more than one person. Electric scooter riders must follow the same Maryland State Laws as cyclists, <a href="https://www.dots.umd.edu/escooter-regulations" target="_blank">according to the official DOTS website.</a></p>

<p>“I saw two girls on the same scooter riding down the hill on Knox Road toward Route 1. They got speed wobbles and then completely fell over, hard,” said Ryan Synk, a senior computer science major. Synk recalled this incident happening in mid-September, just a few weeks after the scooters arrived at the College Park campus.

<p>A few weeks into the spring semester, parking areas designated for scooters by paint popped up around College Park. A potential cause for these new rules could have been incidents resulting from the first semester of scooters on campus. </p>

<p>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the on-campus office for DOTS has been closed until further notice. After multiple attempts to reach out to the department for scooter accident statistics, they could not be reached. </p>

<p>Despite the lack of accident data, a fair share of students have witnessed negligent scooter accidents. Jordan Swarm, a junior Journalism student, came across a scooter crash on her walk to class one day in October.</p>

<p>“I saw a [person on a] scooter going straight and a [person on a] scooter turning left and they completely collided with each other. Both people fell backwards off of their scooters in the middle of the intersection,” said Swarm. </p>

<p>One law DOTS laid out as scooter regulation was abiding by traffic laws like stop signs.
</p>

<p>“Neither of [the people in the collision] were looking where they were going because they were going so fast,” said Swarm. She witnessed this crash at the intersection of Regents Drive and Stadium Drive, which includes a four-way stop. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.veoride.com/safety/" target="_blank">safety section</a> of VeoRide’s official website encourages users to follow standard traffic laws and ride with a helmet.</p>
